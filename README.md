# Joker-ESO
A community addon for [Elder Scrolls Online](https://www.elderscrollsonline.com)


> Best enjoyed with Skooma, Joker offers a collection of various jokes, riddles, & other amusing pop-culture references both in and out of Tamriel. 

> Latest release (v1.0.0) contains Norris jokes (as a test & proof-of-concept; this is my first ESO addon), but more content coming super soon!

## Purpose
Includes 545+ jokes and pop-culture references, instantly available ingame for your leisurely chatting pleasure!

## Dependencies
`LibAddonMenu-2.0` and `LibStub` are bundled in this release, and I'm presently unsure if users need to install them independently (need to test; both are presently installed on my machine)

## Commands
- **/norris**: Add a random Chuck Norris joke to your active chatbox.
- **/norris me**: Add a random joke to your chatbox, with *you* as the subject!
- **/norris *target***: Add a random joke to your chatbox, with `target` as the subject
- More soon!


## Update Roadmap
Always accepting requests, suggestions, etc. Here are a few things currently on the roadmap:

- Popular TV show references & jokes (GoT, Billions, The Walking Dead, Grey's Anatomy, etc etc etc),
- Fun riddles and mindtwisters,
- Add GUI options in Addon settings to enable/disable
